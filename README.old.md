# Exercise

Create a single-page application to display phone contacts and create new ones.

## Description
The home page must load a list of contacts from the provided API and list all the contacts in some sort of table. This application should have search and pagination functions. Pagination can be selected from 5 to 10 per page. The app should provide contact search and a button to create a new one. The form must have the same fields as the attributes from the API. For “Country” field use provided API.

Set of functionalities is not limited, you can play with them and add whatever you want.

## Environment
- Node.js 16+
- NPM 8+
- Git

## Rules
- Treat this assessment like real project.
- Set up a project architecture and keep README or any additional documentation up to date so that anyone can run it quickly.
- Make project available as a public repository on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
- Feel free to choose any git workflow, but commit messages and commit history should be clear.
- Develop with modern browsers in mind, optional support for older browsers.
- Leverage modern ECMAScript features or Typescript.
- Use any modern frontend framework/library or go vanilla, but we prefer React.
- For styles you can use whatever you want, plain CSS, preprocessors such as Sass, LESS, Stylus, PostCSS, etc., framework Tailwind, UI kit such as Material - UI, but keep in mind end result must adhere to responsive design principles.
- If you decide working with multiple applications (frontend, backend), ensure there are no port conflicts.

## Bonus
```
This part is not required, but it will give you imaginary bonus points.
```
- Create a Node backend application that will implement API endpoints.
- Use State management like Redux or Zustand
- Deploy the application on Netlify or something similar. Provide link in README.
- Write a unit, integration, and/or E2E test.
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or similar free service.
- Use Docker
- Send use estimate time before start and track your time and progress.
